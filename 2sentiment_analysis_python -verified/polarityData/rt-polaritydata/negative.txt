@adammshankman Noooo!  You are my favorite judge!  
@adammurlewski damn that looks like fun! I'm still hanging about in the West Country when there's so much going on at home unfortunately 
@adammurlewski I guess, but still, a hint...it's unfair beyond belief  - I bet - nothing changes. It was meant to happen.
@adamnelson Insured yes. Backed up data for YBL, no. Some things money cannot buy 
@adamnyholt Oh, good God!  I will certainly say a prayer for him.  
@adamo seriously?!  ouch.
@AdamOrtega LMFAO! Her eyebrows are a bit thick for me but not bad. He looks kinda ragged, still tons better looking then BC though

@adampiro   they said &quot;HR users needed the privacy&quot;. We said &quot;get access to our stuff and you have access to HR anyway&quot;.  We didn't win 
@adampiro sounds that way, although ipods aren't allowed for us either    working for a German organisation, everything is quite strict!
@adampiro we went to duals &quot;as compensation&quot; for having to sit out in the open area with all the other folks. No IT hidey-hole for us

@adamriggins It does look cool. 10 bucks though. I'm not really a sports fan so doesn't seem worth it for me. Gonna get it? I want hulu 
@adamrowley &quot;The main difference appears to be an enhanced UI for the shopping cart screen. &quot; from TUAW. Nothing exiting 
@adamrowley No idea. Got the missus at home waiting for it 
@adamrucker It won't play! 
@adamrumbold But the rest of it was pretty depressing 
@adamrwaddingham I'm very good thanks. Yeah I'll probably campaign a bit unfortunately I've been an idiot &amp; registered my vote too late 
@AdamSchwabe  that's one of my fave covers ever! I ask him to play it every time I see him live but he never does

@AgingBackwards I know what you mean - I just returned from Ocala with no A/C in my PU. Repair appt not until next Tue 
@AgingBackwards I use to own a 32 lbs tabby cat. Got him for North Shore Animal league he had diabetes 
@AgingBackwards Sure! But I hope there's no murder on the Orient Express. That would add craziness (or great sadness) to our journey   
@AgingBackwards you can see me? I better brush my hair. 
@agirlcalledbob I'm just sad I couldn't witness it... 
@agirlcalledbob Would love to but gotta go.

@AgingBackwards yea but there's no picture of a little smiling whale to calm me down 
@AgingBackwards You think? ! Maybe it's a man posting those ads anyway - exploiting some woman who probably doesn't know! her pic's used!

@ArsenalSarah I'll be out there tomorrow! Catching up on indoor stuff today! 
@alvarlux @feedabah note that he has the Korg MicroKorg, same synth I've used for ages   And Roland Fantom-X6. Neither are plugged in.
