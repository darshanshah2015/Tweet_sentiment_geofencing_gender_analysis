@AceyBongos no Sunshine since 1 Week here  maybe an Xbox....eeehm U.K. exclusive thing this Summer
@AceyBongos not seen them still in aww at the xbox presser wow just wow but it has opened a few questions 
@AceyBongos That means none of my downloaded games will work as my 360 broke a couple of months ago. Everything goes back to trials. 
@AceyBongos You say All of Europe, but still no news of expanding XLive to currently unsupported countries ?

@adammshankman   that makes me sad.......I like when you judge
@adammshankman Good night Adam. Sorry you had to see the ugly side of twitter    99% of the people are good, unfortunately, 1% can be mean
@adammshankman Hey Adam, you can't be permanent judge... then you'd never be able to choreograph  #sytycd
@adammshankman I don't know how follow Friday works either 
@adammshankman Love you on SYTYCD. Your choreography is great. Hope your broken heart is healing.   Much love from Jacksonville, FL.
@adammshankman Noooo!  You are my favorite judge!  
@adammurlewski damn that looks like fun! I'm still hanging about in the West Country when there's so much going on at home unfortunately 
@adammurlewski I guess, but still, a hint...it's unfair beyond belief  - I bet - nothing changes. It was meant to happen.
@adamnelson Insured yes. Backed up data for YBL, no. Some things money cannot buy

@adampiro   they said &quot;HR users needed the privacy&quot;. We said &quot;get access to our stuff and you have access to HR anyway&quot;.  We didn't win 
@adampiro sounds that way, although ipods aren't allowed for us either    working for a German organisation, everything is quite strict!
@adampiro we went to duals &quot;as compensation&quot; for having to sit out in the open area with all the other folks. No IT hidey-hole for us  
@adampolselli thanks skappy!  miss u so much! the vegas isn't the same without u 
@AdamPotts09 HMM...hope you liked the dinner I cooked for you!!...I can't sleep I have heartburn baby!

@alphabetatoast What!! I am sooo jealous 
@alphabitch Oh.  Well, I just endured Twitterus Interruptus because of puking TD. I wish they'd warn us when they have upset tummies.
@Alphacat1 4chan is a HORRIBLE site!They promote screencapping naked girls on cam and posting them to the web w/o the girl knowing! 
@AlphaJD i just need to know what mine is 
@AlphaProofing these things break my heart 
@alphaque It is not working  I think it's time for my Rockstar death
@alphex yea i'd say 90% of the people following me have SEO in their profile 
@alpineusa in car tweeks!! When? When? When? wait..... how much 
@alpowell07 I'm not actually sorry... 
@ArmyOfMeat That's some serious bad karma.  I'm sorry your mom doesn't get her flowers 
@Armywife515 haha why does it throw you off ... i just changed it ... sleepy 
@ArmyWifeNetwork I'm at work!   Unfortunately patients still have eye issues on Saturdays, you'd think their bodies would give me a break!

@Arnibella I only had to read it and it made me feel terrible...I can't bear animal cruelty. I  won't even watch the video 
@arnodrost it is a pretty big list...  but still.. there goes my anonymity 
@alrightmousey Worst day ever! Me&amp;my brother were reading them together &amp; I had to leave the room so he wouldn't laugh at my tears 
@Alris I guess so, but Twitterberry is such a nice program 
@Alsenoth I don't have any cash dude  how good are the chances of them being free?
@AlSharpTongue I said how is it messin up ur blackberry? And u said yes...so now I'm confused b/c it wasn't a yes/no question 
@Alska @Andrea__P If I wasn't struggling to get my meds refilled I'd definitely be buying from you both. Disability doesn't pay me much. 
@Alska @dragonkeeper I didn't make it even halfway through the show I was so tired  I actually fell asleep with the tv on for once!
@alsoekim it stopped raining, and the sun came out, so i rode to the plaza in just a t-shirt... was bucketing down on the way home 
@alsointocats omg I want to color  and I thought of you today because I realized I need to start making a ~list~
@alsotop yeah they look pretty ewwie! But they taste om-nom-liciouz. And I dont have the tools to make my own

@arsachs my dream is to be on cash cab. i exclusively take van cabs to try to make this dream a reality...still no dice dude!! 
@arsenal_fann Lucky shit! Wish I had one... 
@arsenalista that's terrible news. i think what's worse is the not knowing exactly what happened  and that they may never know 
@ArsenalSarah I'll be out there tomorrow! Catching up on indoor stuff today! 
@alvarlux @feedabah note that he has the Korg MicroKorg, same synth I've used for ages   And Roland Fantom-X6. Neither are plugged in.
@alvarlux it was so freaking hot in the bakery today   I melted
@AlvinYeh I have the now defunct iPhone 3G  I can type pretty quickly though - just learn to trust the autocorrect! What're you up to now?
@always_be is amazazing! I miss her. 
@always_elle thats great! bc last night Trish found that LO, Sasha, Luke and Drew wouldn't be there

@alwayscandace heyyyyyy. i miss you. come chat. 
@alwayscoffee With this economy, I imagine only super-established writers are even getting considered. 
@art_n_booklife I heard about that too... that seems an overreaction... 
@Art_News ~ My bad     #followArt
@art_pollution OH MY gosh!  Wow I am so sorry!

@artemisrex I'm sorry mister!  didn't mean to be an antip-
@Artemyst Yeah, I doubt it'll be coming out soon anytime soon (if ever :p) I also doubt it'll run on my computer. ????? 
@alwayswatching How do I get the $100 price cut?

@alyankovic couldnt get my question in edgewise with all the questions people were asking  sad panda!
@alyankovic I like that your new profile pic is less pimptastic, but @ludovicah has a point with it not being a recent picture 
@alyankovic Is there a lower quality version of that video? HD skips BADLY on my netbook 
@alyankovic oddly enough, he is MORE disturbing with the hair out of his face!!! PS couldn't see Jason Bateman 
@alyankovic which song is this a parody of? I'm not bing into Doors and I can't remember D: I feel like a bad music fan
